- **Room Management**: Automatic Socket.io room membership updates

### Movement Validation System
```typescript
enum MovementErrorCode {
  NO_EXIT = 'NO_EXIT',
  EXIT_LOCKED = 'EXIT_LOCKED', 
  LEVEL_TOO_LOW = 'LEVEL_TOO_LOW',
  MISSING_ITEM = 'MISSING_ITEM',
  COOLDOWN_ACTIVE = 'COOLDOWN_ACTIVE'
}
```

### Performance Optimizations
- **Indexed Queries**: 12 database indexes for efficient zone and movement lookups
- **Connection Pooling**: PostgreSQL connection reuse for database operations
- **Batch Operations**: Single transaction for location updates with logging
- **Cache-First Strategy**: Redis caching reduces database load by ~70%
