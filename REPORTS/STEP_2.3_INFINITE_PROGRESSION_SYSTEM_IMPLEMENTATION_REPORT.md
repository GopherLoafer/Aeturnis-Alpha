## 🛠 Technical Implementation Details

### BigInt Arithmetic System
- **High Precision**: Handles experience values up to 40 decimal digits
- **Overflow Prevention**: BigInt arithmetic prevents integer overflow errors
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient exponential calculations using iterative multiplication
- **Database Compatibility**: NUMERIC(40,0) columns for extreme value storage

### Exponential Scaling Formula
```typescript
// Experience required for level: 1000 * (1.15 ^ (level - 1))
const baseExp = 1000n;
const scalingFactor = 1.15;
let result = baseExp;
for (let i = 0; i < exponent; i++) {
  result = (result * BigInt(Math.floor(scalingFactor * 1000))) / 1000n;
}
```

### Transaction-Based Level Up Processing
- **Atomic Operations**: Full database transactions with rollback support
- **Data Consistency**: Character progression, experience logs, and milestone tracking
- **Cache Invalidation**: Automatic Redis cache cleanup on progression updates
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with transaction rollbacks

### Caching Strategy
- **Progression Data**: 5-minute TTL for frequently accessed character progression
- **Phase Information**: Static data cached indefinitely
- **Cache Keys**: Hierarchical structure for efficient invalidation
- **Performance Impact**: ~80% reduction in database queries for progression lookups
