## Additional Notes

Real-Time Communication Layer for Aeturnis Online MMORPG - COMPREHENSIVE IMPLEMENTATION REPORT

🚀 PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Built a production-ready Socket.io real-time communication system for Aeturnis Online MMORPG. This layer handles all real-time events including character movement, combat actions, chat messages, and game state synchronization across multiple server instances using Redis.

📋 IMPLEMENTATION SCOPE:
✅ Socket.io Server Setup with Redis Adapter
✅ JWT Authentication Middleware for Socket Connections
✅ Comprehensive Room Management System (6 room types)
✅ Real-Time Event Handlers (Connection, Character, Combat, Chat)
✅ Presence Management with Activity Tracking
✅ Advanced Rate Limiting with Redis Sliding Window
✅ Realtime Service for Broadcasting Events
✅ Security Layer with Input Validation and Anti-Cheat
✅ Monitoring and Metrics Collection
✅ API Integration for Administrative Functions

🏗️ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:

CORE INFRASTRUCTURE:
- Socket.io server integrated with Express HTTP server
- Redis adapter for horizontal scaling across multiple instances
- CORS configuration matching Express API for seamless integration
- Transport upgrade: polling → WebSocket with optimized timeouts
- Connection heartbeat monitoring (25s interval, 60s timeout)
- Graceful shutdown with proper connection cleanup

AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY:
- JWT verification middleware with comprehensive token validation
- Rate limiting for failed authentication (5 attempts/15min per IP)
- Token blacklist checking with Redis storage for security
- Multiple token extraction methods (auth object, headers, query)
- User metadata attachment (userId, characterId, roles)
- Session tracking with automatic cleanup and TTL management

ROOM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:
- user:{userId} - Personal notifications and direct messages
- character:{characterId} - Player-specific events and updates
- zone:{zoneName} - Area-based communication (e.g., 'zone:starting_village')
- combat:{sessionId} - Battle instance management
- guild:{guildId} - Guild communications and events
- global:chat & global:events - Server-wide announcements
- Room access validation with ownership verification
- Automatic cleanup on disconnect, restoration on reconnect

REAL-TIME EVENT PROCESSING:

Connection Handler:
- Complete lifecycle management with comprehensive logging
- Presence restoration with state synchronization on reconnect
- Room cleanup with broadcast notifications on disconnect
- Initial sync data delivery and missed event handling

Character Handler:
- Character selection with database ownership validation
- Real-time movement with anti-cheat speed/distance validation
- Action processing with cooldown checks and permissions
- Status updates with zone-wide broadcasting capabilities
- Movement validation for game integrity

Combat Handler:
- Turn-based combat session management with state tracking
- Action validation (attack, defend, skill, item) with game rules
- Turn order enforcement and result broadcasting
- Flee attempt processing with calculated success rates
- Real-time state synchronization for all participants

Chat Handler:
- Multi-channel messaging (zone, global, guild) with permissions
- Private whisper system with online status and block lists
- Emote system with zone broadcasting and validation
- Chat history with pagination and access control
- Typing indicators with real-time status updates
- Content filtering and profanity detection

PRESENCE MANAGEMENT:
- Redis-based tracking with configurable TTL (1 hour)
- Activity timeline for analytics (100 activities per user)
- Real-time online user statistics and monitoring
- Automatic away status after inactivity (5 minutes)
- State restoration on reconnect with previous context
- Stale session cleanup and connection management

RATE LIMITING SYSTEM:
- Redis sliding window algorithm for distributed limiting
- Event-specific configurations:
  * Chat messages: 10/minute
  * Character movement: 30/minute
  * Combat actions: 20/minute
  * Global connections: 10/minute (5min block)
- Per-user tracking with automatic reset and cleanup
- Client notifications for rate limit violations

REALTIME SERVICE INTEGRATION:
- Centralized broadcasting for all event types
- Zone-based targeting for area-specific events
- User/character-specific messaging for personal updates
- Guild communication system integration
- Global announcements with priority levels
- Bulk notification system for administrative functions
- Game state updates for synchronized world events

📊 MONITORING & METRICS:
- Real-time connection count and statistics tracking
- Active room monitoring with participant counts
- Event performance measurement with duration tracking
- Comprehensive error logging with context and stack traces
- Redis session health monitoring and management
- Broadcast event metrics and system performance data
- Health endpoint integration for service status

🔗 API INTEGRATION:
- /api/realtime/stats - Connection and room statistics
- /api/realtime/announcement - System-wide announcements
- /api/realtime/notify - Targeted user notifications
- Swagger documentation for all realtime endpoints
- Authentication middleware for administrative functions
