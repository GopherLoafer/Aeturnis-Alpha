## Repository Implementation

### CharacterRepository Class
**File:** `server/src/database/repositories/CharacterRepository.ts`

Production-ready repository with comprehensive functionality:

#### Race Management
- `getAllRaces()`: Get all available races
- `getRaceById(raceId)`: Get specific race information

#### Character CRUD Operations
- `create(userId, data)`: Create character with race bonus calculations
- `findById(id)`: Get character by ID with soft deletion support
- `findByUserId(userId)`: Get all user characters
- `getCharacterStats(id)`: Get character with calculated race bonuses
- `softDelete(id)`: Soft delete character (preserves data)
- `isNameAvailable(name)`: Check character name availability

#### Character Updates
- `updateStats(id, partialStats)`: Update character base stats
- `updateLocation(id, zone, x, y)`: Update character position
- `updateResources(id, health, mana)`: Update health/mana
- `updateStatus(id, status)`: Update character status

#### Zone and Social Features
- `getCharactersInZone(zoneId)`: Get all characters in specific zone

### Character Creation Logic

The character creation process implements sophisticated race bonus calculations:

1. **Race Validation:** Verify race exists and fetch race data
2. **Stat Calculation:** Apply race modifiers to base stats
3. **Resource Calculation:** Calculate starting health/mana based on stats
4. **Zone Assignment:** Use race's starting zone and spawn zone
5. **Gold Assignment:** Use race's starting gold amount
6. **Database Transaction:** Ensure data consistency
7. **Audit Logging:** Track character creation for monitoring

## Type Safety and Validation

### Comprehensive Type System
**File:** `server/src/types/character.types.ts`

#### Core Interfaces
- `Race`: Complete race definition with all attributes
- `Character`: Full character interface with all fields
- `CharacterStats`: Extended character with calculated race bonuses
- `CharacterCreationData`: Character creation with race bonuses applied

#### Input/Output Types
- `CreateCharacterInput`: Type-safe character creation
- `UpdateCharacterStatsInput`: Partial stat updates
- `UpdateCharacterResourcesInput`: Health/mana updates
- `UpdateCharacterLocationInput`: Position updates

#### Constants and Enums
- `CHARACTER_CONSTANTS`: Default values and scaling factors
- `RACE_NAMES`: Standardized race name constants
- `Gender`: Type-safe gender enumeration
- `CharacterStatus`: Valid character status values

## Database Testing and Verification

### Migration Success
All database migrations executed successfully:

- ✅ character_stats view: Calculated stats view created

### Character Creation Flow Testing
Comprehensive testing performed to verify the system:

```sql
-- Test character creation with Human race
INSERT INTO characters (user_id, race_id, name, gender, ...)
-- Verified: Race bonuses correctly applied
-- Result: Character created with proper stat calculations

-- Test character_stats view
SELECT name, race_name, total_strength, health, max_health, gold
FROM character_stats WHERE name = 'TestCharacter'
-- Result: Calculated stats correctly combined base + race modifiers
```

### Performance Validation
