## 🛠 Technical Implementation Details

### Service Layer Architecture
- **CharacterService**: Core business logic with dependency injection
- **CacheManager Integration**: Redis-based caching with configurable TTL
- **Database Transactions**: Atomic operations for character creation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with structured logging

### Controller Design Patterns
- **Validation Middleware**: Express-validator with custom rules
- **Error Response Standardization**: Consistent error format across all endpoints
- **Rate Limiting Integration**: Different limits for different operation types
- **Request/Response Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration

### Database Integration
- **CharacterRepository Usage**: Leverages existing Step 2.1 infrastructure

### Caching Strategy
- **Character Data**: 5-minute TTL for frequently accessed character information
- **Race Information**: 1-hour TTL for relatively static race data
- **Cache Invalidation**: Automatic cleanup on character deletion
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces database load for character retrieval
