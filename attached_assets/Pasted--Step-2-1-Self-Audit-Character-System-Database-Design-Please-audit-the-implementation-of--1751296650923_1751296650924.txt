### ✅ Audit Checklist

#### 📁 Migrations
- [ ] `races` table includes:
  - [ ] Name, lore, description fields
  - [ ] Stat modifiers: strength, vitality, dexterity, intelligence, wisdom
  - [ ] Progression bonuses: experience, weapon_affinity, magic_affinity
  - [ ] Starting values: health, mana, zone, gold
  - [ ] JSONB fields: traits, restrictions, abilities
  - [ ] Constraints: numeric ranges, default values
- [ ] `characters` table includes:
  - [ ] Progression: level, experience, next_level_exp
  - [ ] Stats: strength, etc.
  - [ ] Resources: current/max health & mana
  - [ ] Location: current zone, x/y, spawn zone
  - [ ] Inventory: gold, slots, capacity
  - [ ] Customization: appearance, active title
  - [ ] Lifecycle fields: created_at, last_active, soft delete
  - [ ] Constraints: `level >= 1`, `health <= max_health`, enum status

#### 📈 View
- [ ] `character_stats` view joins races and characters
- [ ] Derived columns: `total_strength`, etc.
- [ ] Includes race name and experience bonus

#### 🧱 Indexing
- [ ] Indexes on: `user_id`, `zone`, `level`, `last_active`
- [ ] Partial index for `deleted_at IS NULL`

#### 🧩 Repository Layer
- [ ] `CharacterRepository.ts` includes:
  - `create`, `findById`, `findByUserId`
  - `updateStats`, `updateLocation`, `updateResources`
  - `softDelete`
- [ ] Uses parameterized queries
- [ ] Type-safe inputs and returns

#### 🔐 Best Practices
- [ ] Foreign keys enforced on `user_id`, `race_id`
- [ ] TypeScript types match DB schema
- [ ] SQL fields include comments for clarity
- [ ] All critical fields defaulted or validated

### 📤 Deliverables Check

- [ ] SQL migrations placed in `/src/database/migrations/`
- [ ] View file in `/src/database/views/`
- [ ] TypeScript repo in `/src/repositories/`
- [ ] Ready for next-step integration
