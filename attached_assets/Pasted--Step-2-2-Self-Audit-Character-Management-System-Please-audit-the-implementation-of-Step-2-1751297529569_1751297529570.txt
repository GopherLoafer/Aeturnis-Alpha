Please audit the implementation of Step 2.2: Character Management System. This includes service logic, controller endpoints, validation, and integration.

## âœ… Audit Checklist

### 1. CharacterService
- [ ] `createCharacter` properly validates name, race, and user limits
- [ ] Race modifiers are applied to base stats
- [ ] Starting zone and gold from race are set
- [ ] `getUserCharacters` only returns undeleted characters for user
- [ ] `getCharacter` validates ownership and returns full character
- [ ] `selectCharacter` updates session and prepares Socket.io rooms
- [ ] `deleteCharacter` performs soft deletion (sets `deleted_at`)
- [ ] Uses transactions where needed

### 2. CharacterController
- [ ] All 5 endpoints implemented (create, list, get, select, delete)
- [ ] Route validation is enforced (express-validator or equivalent)
- [ ] Proper status codes and error messages returned

### 3. Input Validation
- [ ] Name: 3â€“20 chars, alphanumeric, no duplicates
- [ ] Race: UUID, must exist
- [ ] Gender: enum enforced
- [ ] Appearance: optional, well-formed object

### 4. Session & Socket Integration
- [ ] `selectCharacter` updates user session with `characterId`
- [ ] Character joins appropriate Socket.io rooms
- [ ] Zone entry is validated

### 5. Audit Logging
- [ ] Character creation and deletion logged to `audit_log`
- [ ] Includes userId, action, resource type, characterId, timestamp

### 6. File Organization
- [ ] Code is modular and located in proper directories:
  - `/services/CharacterService.ts`
  - `/controllers/CharacterController.ts`
  - `/types/character.types.ts`
- [ ] Routes integrated properly

## ðŸ“¤ Deliverable Check
- [ ] Characters can be created and selected by users
- [ ] Deletion hides characters (soft delete)
- [ ] System uses validated, typed DTOs
- [ ] Full error handling present
