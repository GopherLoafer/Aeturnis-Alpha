# ðŸ§ª Step 2.5 â€“ Selfâ€‘Audit: Combat System Foundation

Please audit the implementation of the turnâ€‘based Combat System. Verify schema, service logic, realâ€‘time hooks, and API layer.

---

## âœ… Audit Checklist

### 1. Schema
- [ ] `combat_sessions` table with state, round, turn, timestamps
- [ ] `combat_participants` with initiative, current/max HP, status
- [ ] `combat_actions_log` capturing action, target, value, crit
- [ ] Indexes on session state, zone, participant_id

### 2. CombatService
- [ ] `startEncounter` rolls initiative, populates participants, broadcasts `combat:start`
- [ ] `performAction` checks turn order, cooldowns, status (alive), computes damage & crit
- [ ] `getSession` returns full session with participants & turn info (cached)
- [ ] `endEncounter` sets state completed, distributes XP/loot placeholders
- [ ] All DB operations transactional; logs written to `combat_actions_log`

### 3. Damage & Crit Formula
- [ ] Base formula: `(STR âˆ’ VIT) * weaponCoef` with floor â‰¥â€¯1
- [ ] Crit chance: `5â€¯% + DEX /â€¯200`; crit damage Ã—1.5
- [ ] Respects participant buffs / debuffs stubs

### 4. Cooldowns & Validation
- [ ] 1 action / second per participant (Redis rate limiter)
- [ ] Only active participant may act
- [ ] Blocks if session ended or participant dead/busy

### 5. API Endpoints
- [ ] `/api/combat/start` starts encounter (auth, active character)
- [ ] `/api/combat/:id/action` performs action with DTO validation
- [ ] `/api/combat/:id` returns session snapshot
- [ ] Proper status codes & error format

### 6. Socket Events
- [ ] Room `combat:{sessionId}` created
- [ ] Broadcast `combat:update` on each action & HP change
- [ ] Broadcast `combat:end` when encounter finishes

### 7. Logging & Monitoring
- [ ] Each action logged with value, crit flag, round/turn
- [ ] Levelâ€‘up / XP placeholder hooks included
- [ ] Performance metrics or winston logging added
